## STOCK PRICE PREDICTION
I am importing the contemporary data of stocks from the yfinance library.
The stock data I am collecting are from APPLE, GOOGLE, MICROSOFT AND AMAZON
The stock data starts from last year to the current time.
I then plot graphs to represent the closing price of all the companies for each month.
Likewise, I also plot graph for volume of sales and the moving average of various stocks for 10 days,
20 days and 50 days respective to the companies.
I also plot a graph for the average daily return for each company.
